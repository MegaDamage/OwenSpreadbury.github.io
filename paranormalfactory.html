                Then, if he were to see a player, he would stop and look around. If the player is seen enough, he will come over to investigate.
                If the player is seen further still, he would chase them until he is close enough to attack.

                The player is forced to consider their own survival as they navigate and solve puzzles.
                This can especially be a handful if the player is busy capturing ghost essence.
